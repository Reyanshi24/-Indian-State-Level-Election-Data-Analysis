# Indian State-Level Election Data Analysis
A data analysis project that explores detailed insights into Indian State-Level Elections. This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (detailed_election_insights.ipynb) that performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover trends, party performance, and voting patterns across various constituencies.

# Project Overview
Elections in India are massive democratic exercises generating vast amounts of data. This project aims to simplify and visualize this data to understand the political landscape better. The analysis focuses on state-level metrics, providing a granular view of election outcomes.

---

# Key Objectives:

Analyze the performance of major political parties and alliances.

Visualize vote shares and seat distributions.

Examine victory margins and constituency-level details.

Provide data-driven insights into regional political trends.

---

# Key Features & Insights
The detailed_election_insights.ipynb notebook includes the following analyses:

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handling missing values and standardizing dataset formats for analysis.

Party-wise Performance: Analysis of total seats won by different parties (e.g., BJP, INC, Regional Parties).

Vote Share Analysis: Visualizations depicting the percentage of votes secured by major contenders.

Victory Margins: Analysis of close contests versus landslide victories.

State-wise Breakdown: Detailed look at election results within specific states.

Visualizations: Usage of Bar Charts, Pie Charts, and Histograms to represent data effectively.

---

# Tech Stack
The project is built using Python and the following data science libraries:

Python: Core programming language.

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis (DataFrames).

NumPy: For numerical computations.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization and plotting.

# Results
The analysis processes state-level election data to reveal a distinct polarization in voting patterns. The key finding is the disproportionate relationship between vote share and seat share, where dominant parties in specific states secure a landslide in seats despite a moderate vote share increase (First-Past-The-Post system effect).
